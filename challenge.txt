** EXERCISE **

You have been contracted by a home removals company to develop a web­application to

allow their customers to record the contents of their home.

For each item the application should record: which room it is in, the weight of the item, a

description of the item, and whether the item is fragile or not. The application should show

a summary of the items already recorded, broken down by room, and allow items to be

added, removed and modified.

Finally to ease the moving process the application should be able to generate a manifest

view for the movers. This view should contain three sections: the two heaviest items per

room, the fragile items, and all remaining items. Each entry should have the item's

description, the weight, and the room in which it can be found.
